# CSC_161_Personal_Project

## MAD Comics Web Page
### This project is intended to be an ongoing archive of comic strips created by me. The front page displays the most recent comic and a list of the comic strips in order of creation, not neccessarily when they were published (I realize the list does not make this clear, will implement a 'created on:' eventually) This project will ultimately serve as a portfolio for some of my work, and eventually have more information about me and so forth
